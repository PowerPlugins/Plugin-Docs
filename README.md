# PowerPlugins' Plugin Documentation
PowerPlugins tries to give both developers and users a place to test and showcase.  
But we also want to provide a place, where users can find information about various plugins.

This is why we created this repository.  
It contains information about plugins that either lack a wiki, or miss some information about specific features you may wanna use.

You can find a live-version of the documentation under https://plugins.powerplugins.net

## Adding a plugin
Do you know a plugin that is awesome, but lacks a wiki to explain specific features? Add it here!  
Just create a new markdown (.md) file with the name of the plugin inside the `docs/plugins` directory and add the path (without `docs/`) to the `mkdocs.yml` under the `nav` section.

If you want to use images, upload them under `docs/assets/img/plugins`.  
Please create a separate folder named after the plugin, where you upload those files towards.
