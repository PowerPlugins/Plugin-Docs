# PowerPlugins' Open Source Wiki
Welcome to the repository for the open source wiki of PowerPlugins.net!  
This is the source of what you can find over at https://wiki.powerplugins.net.

## The Goal
PowerPlugins tries to help both developers and normal players with plugins. This first started as a public test server for plugins and has since then expanded to this open wiki!  
If you're a developer and want to have a wiki-section dedicated to your project(s), make a PR to add your wiki pages! But before that, always make sure you've read our [Contributing Guidelines][Contributing] and also the [Styling Guide].

## Support
We offer this wiki and our test server free of charge and therefore don't make any real revenue from it.  
If you want to help us, feel free to [donate something][donate] so that we can keep running the server for free!
