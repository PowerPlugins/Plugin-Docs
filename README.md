# PowerPlugins' Plugin Documentation
PowerPlugins tries to give both developers and users a place to test and showcase plugins of all kinds and genres.  
But we also want to provide a place, where users can find information about various plugins.

This is why we created this repository.  
It contains information about plugins that either lack a wiki, or miss some information about specific features you may wanna use.

You can find a live-version of the documentation under https://wiki.powerplugins.net

## Adding a plugin
Do you know a plugin that is awesome, but lacks a wiki to explain specific features? Add it here!  

Just create a new folder (name it after the plugin) under the `docs/plugins` directory, add markdown (`.md`) files to it and start writing!  
Please make sure to take a look at the [Contributing] page and the [Styling Guide] to not make any formatting errors.
