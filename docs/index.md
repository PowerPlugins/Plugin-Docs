# Welcome
Welcome to the Open-Source Wiki of PowerPlugins.net!

It is our goal to provide a place, where developers can host a wiki for their project(s) free of charge!  
Why? Because we want to offer a good looking place for everyone to provide information in and other places are just fairly limited.

## How to contribute
If you know a project that doesn't have a wiki (yet) and you would like to provide one, head over to the [Contributing page](contributing) to find out how.  
Please also take a look at our [Styling Guide](contributing/styling-guide) to get an idea on how to properly format the site.

If you need more information, do not hesitate to ask us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/psPECvY) or through E-Mail at support@powerplugins.net!

Have fun :smile:
