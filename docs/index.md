# Welcome
Welcome to the plugin Documentation of PowerPlugins.net!

It is our goal to provide a place, where plugin developers can provide a place for their plugin-wiki, free of charge!  
Why? Because we want to offer a good looking place for everyone to provide information.

## How to contribute
If you know a plugin that doesn't have a wiki (yet) and you would like to provide one, head over to the [Contributing page](../contributing) to find out how.  
Please also take a look at our [Styling Guide](../styling-guide) to get an idea on how to properly format the site.

If you need more information, do not hesitate to ask us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/psPECvY) or through E-Mail at support@powerplugins.net!

Have fun :smile:
