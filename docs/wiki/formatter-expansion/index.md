The Formatter Expansion is a PlaceholderAPI expansion which allows to format a (large) number (e.g. `1234567890` to `1,234,567,890`)

!!! info "Note"
    The style of the Number depends on what [locale](locale) was set.  
    For example would `de_DE` turn `1000000` into `1'000'000` while `en_US` would change it to `1,000,0000`.
